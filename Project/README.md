# SageMaker Deployment Project

* The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews.

* The application architecture diagram is:

* This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background. The main steps in the project are:
    + Step 1: Downloading the data
    + Step 2: Preparing and Processing the data
    + Step 3: Upload the data to S3
    + Step 4: Build and Train the PyTorch Model
    + Step 5: Testing the Model
    + Step 6: Deploying the model for testing
    + Step 7: Use the model for testing
    + Step 6 Deploy the model for the web app
    + Step 7 Use the model for the web app

* Please see the [README](https://github.com/liangliang-yang/udacity-sagemaker-deployment/blob/master/README.md) in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).
